**Abstract**

Canadian regulations cover a wide range of departments and regulatory agencies
and with the immense increases in regulations, topic modelling with Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was utilized in order to go through the regulations
and find topic words that commonly occurred together with the topic.

After preprocessing the data, topic modelling with LDA was applied to the
Canadian regulationsâ€™ dataset from The Justice Canada website. It was observed
that there were 60 different topics out of the 2062 Canadian regulations. Topic
modelling using LDA helped the reader get a quick overview of the entire dataset
of Canadian regulations. From this, we were able to establish the topic labels
using the commonly occurs words that frequent the topic label.

Visualizations were generated in presenting the results because they helped to
show the same results in different ways. This further enhanced the comprehension
of regulations summary.

The next proposed step for this project would be applying trend analysis. It
could help to determine future models by finding patterns within historical and
current data which would be relevant towards forecasting topic trends in future
Canadian regulations.
